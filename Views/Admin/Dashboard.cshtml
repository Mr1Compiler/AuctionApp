🏠 What is the Admin Dashboard?
The dashboard is the admin’s main page — a summary view that shows key system info at a glance.

Think of it as a control center — it doesn't do deep actions, but shows stats, alerts, and quick links to where the admin might want to go next.

✅ What Should It Contain?
Here's a simple and useful list of what your admin dashboard could show:

1. Pending Auctions Summary
Number of auctions waiting approval
👉 Link to /Admin/PendingAuctions

2. Total Auctions Count
Approved / Sold / Cancelled counts
👉 Link to /Admin/Auctions

3. User Summary
Total users

Blocked users
👉 Link to /Admin/Users

4. Recent Activity
Last 5 auctions created

Last 5 bids
👉 Could link to details






example:
| Pending Auctions: 4     | Total Users: 124      |
| Approved Auctions: 93   | Blocked Users: 5      |

Recent Auctions:
- "iPhone 13" by user123 — Pending
- "Old Camera" by user567 — Approved

Quick Actions:
[Go to Pending Auctions] [Manage Users]
