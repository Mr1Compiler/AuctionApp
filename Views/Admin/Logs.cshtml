📊 What is the Logs Page?
The Logs (or Reports) page shows a history of important actions in the system — what happened, who did it, and when.
It's mainly for admin auditing and monitoring activity, like:
Who created or deleted an auction?
Who placed a bid?
Which auctions were approved, rejected, or canceled?
Who got banned?




🔍 Log Page Features
You could include:

A table with filter/sort by:

Action type (e.g., Bid, Auction, User Management)
Date range
Username
Optional search box
Pagination (if logs are many)


*important => we should create new table for the logs so we can store them in DB.
